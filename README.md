# 20 Games Challenge

This repository hosts my personal attempt at the 20 Games Challenge.
Each folder in the repository contains all the code related to a part of the challenge; I hope the directory names will be self-explanatory.

## The backstory and rationale behind this project:

The main objectives are:
- Put to the test my knowledge (and possibly increase it) of C++20
- Learn how to code on the Microsoft Window platform.
- Make some games

I decided to implement all the infrastructural code from scratch for this challenge, 
and then reuse what done here in the next challenges.

The idea is using C++20 as the language of choice, and minimizing the dependencies as much as possible.

The other big thing about this challenge is the fact i never coded anything on Windows.
Being a Terminal nerd, and a little obsessed with the idea of making stuff with minimal tools, 
I decided that I would code without using Visual Studio.
After some failed attempts setting up all the dependencies from the Cmd i acknowledged that I haven't got
enough familiarity with the platform to do that.

Hence here I am, coding in Visual Studio, with GLFW + OpenGL and my own willpower.
> I would like to stress, that no AI will ever be used in the process of developing this code (it wouldn't make sense)!

The main allowed resources are:
- [Official OpenGL docs](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenGL-Refpages/gl4/)
- [Cpp Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/)
- [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com)

And many research papers that I will talk about in the various parts of the repo.
